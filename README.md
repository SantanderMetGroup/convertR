# `convertR`: A climate4R package for unit conversion and variable derivation

`convertR` is an R package performing unit conversion and variable derivation using the [**climate4R**](http://meteo.unican.es/climate4r) Common Data Model.

## Installation and requirements

Physical quantity handling is done via the Unidata's [UDUNITS-2](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) software libraries, tailoring the functionalities of the R package `udunits2` to the **climate4R** framework. Thus, the C-based UDUNITS-2 package **must be installed in your system** prior to package installation ([link to installation instructions](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-current/doc/udunits/udunits2.html#Installation)).

Then, `install_github` can be used:

```R
devtools::install_github("SantanderMetGroup/convertR")
```

## Unit conversion

The function `udConvertGrid` is used for unit conversion. An example follows:

```R
library(convertR)
data("ps.iberia")
transformeR::getGridUnits(ps.iberia)
## [1] "Pascals"
range(ps.iberia$Data)
## [1]  86657.5 105690.0
ps.mmHg <- udConvertGrid(ps.iberia, new.units = "mmHg")
transformeR::getGridUnits(ps.mmHg)
## [1] "mmHg"
range(ps.mmHg$Data)
## [1] 649.9846 792.7401
```

## Available variable derivations

In the following table the available variable derivations are summarized, including the input variables. The nomenclature of the input variables to calculate the derivations is according to the [climate4R vocabulary](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/loadeR/blob/devel/inst/vocabulary.txt) (see `loadeR::c4R.vocabulary()`)

The (*) symbol indicates that the function is planned but not yet available.

The input variables do not require to be in specific units, as all the necessary unit conversions are internally undertaken by the unit converter utility.
